Project based in xaf blazor.
My role was to create a new module named ASAP_RECORDS.
Based on a database view I needed to show them on a listview and be able to select eah one of them and if the user decided to click on new, to create a new Asap_Record, if not, it was just a new version under an existing Asap_Record.
Also I used JS to control a behavior on text field to make sure it scrolled down automatically as text was appended.
